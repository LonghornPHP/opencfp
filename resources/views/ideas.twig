    <h2>Talk Ideas</h2>
    <p>
        {{ site.title }} is not limited to just PHP-related talks. There have been
        sessions covering a wide range of topics supporting PHP developers and DevOps
        as well, and we encourage you to "think outside the box" to come up with your
        own unique topics.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>We strongly advise that you submit a few talk ideas, not just one.</strong>
        By submitting a single talk you may lessen your chances of being selected.
    </p>
    <p>
        To get the ideas flowing, here's a few suggestions:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Virtualization and environments</li>
        <li>Javascript</li>
        <li>Alternate PHP run-times</li>
        <li>PHP internals</li>
        <li>Development principles</li>
        <li>Security</li>
        <li>Mobile-first design</li>
        <li>Testing (unit, functional, etc.)</li>
        <li>Version control</li>
        <li>User Experience/Usability</li>
        <li>Building APIs (REST, SOAP, whatever)</li>
        <li>Continuous Integration</li>
        <li>Framework-related topics</li>
        <li>Professional development</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Session Types</h2>
    <p>This year, we'll be accepting talks for three different session lengths: 
    3-hour tutorials, 60 minute talks, and 30 minute talks.</p>
    <p><b>Tutorial</b> - These are interactive hands-on workshops, meant for diving into a topic.</p>
    <p><b>Talks</b> - This year, we have introduced a few 30 minute sessions, 
    in addition to the classic 60 minute talk session. 
    When submitting your talk, you'll see a few options for the time, so you can choose 
    whether your talk would fit in a 60 or 30 minute session.
    If you can be flexible on the length, this makes it more likely we can accept the talk. 
    You can select either 60 or 30 minutes only, or indicate that you can do either length, 
    and pick the preferred length.</p>
