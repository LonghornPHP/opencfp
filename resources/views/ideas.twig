    <h2>Talk Ideas</h2>
    <p>
        {{ site.title }} is not limited to just PHP-related talks. There have been
        sessions covering a wide range of topics supporting PHP Developers, Front-End Developers,
        DevOps Teams and Leadership as well.
        We encourage you to "think outside the box" to come up with your own unique topics.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>We strongly advise that you submit a few talk ideas, not just one.</strong>
        By submitting a single talk you may lessen your chances of being selected.
    </p>
    <p>
        To get the ideas flowing, here's a few suggestions:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Virtualization and environments, Docker, Serverless</li>
        <li>PHP internals</li>
        <li>Development principles, code quality</li>
        <li>Building APIs (REST, SOAP)</li>
        <li>Continuous Integration and Delivery</li>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <li>Databases</li>
        <li>Security</li>
        <li>Mobile-first design, Responsive Design, CSS</li>
        <li>User Experience (UI/UX), Usability, Accessibility</li>
        <li>Testing</li>
        <li>Frameworks (Laravel, Symfony, Wordpress, and more)</li>
        <li>Professional development and skills</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Session Types</h2>
    <p>This year, we'll be accepting talks for two session lengths:
        3 hour tutorials, and ~50 minute talks.</p>
    <p><b>Tutorial</b> - These are interactive hands-on workshops, meant for diving into a topic.</p>
    <p><b>Talks</b> - This is a standard presentation time slot; your presentation should run
        around 50 minutes, including time for questions should you choose to take them from
        on stage. If you would like to submit a keynote idea, use this talk type, though
        keynote time slots will be somewhat shorter.</p>
