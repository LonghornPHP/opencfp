    <h2>{{ site.title }} Speaker Information</h2>
    <p>
        We're committed to bringing together some of the best speakers from all around the
        world to share their knowledge with you here. We provide a travel and
        accommodation package to all selected speakers to help make this possible.
    </p>
    <h3>About the event</h3>
    <p>
        Every room will have a projector, screen, and some video adapters, though to be on the
        safe side you'll want to bring your own HDMI adapter. WiFi internet will be available
        throughout the venue, though connection reliability will vary.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once the Call for Papers closes on July 20th, we will sort
        through the submissions, making our selections. Once the selection process has been completed,
        everyone who submitted a talk will be notified promptly as to whether or not their talk has been accepted.
    </p>
    <h3>What we provide for Selected Speakers</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>For all speakers, you'll get a full conference pass (tutorial day and main conference days),
            including access to lunch, after-parties, and any other activities included in the conference.</li>
        <li>For speakers remote to the Austin area, we'll provide 3 nights
            (4 nights if presenting a talk and a tutorial) at the conference venue, which is also the speaker hotel.</li>
        <li>For speakers outside Texas, we'll book you round-trip airfare on a flight into
            Austin we'd be comfortable taking ourselves (we're conference speakers too!). Plus, we'll arrange
            transportation between the Austin airport and the speaker hotel.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        International speakers are encouraged to <a href="/">submit their talks</a>, but because of budget restrictions,
        we can only afford to pay airfare for a limited number of international speakers.
    </p>
    <h3>Tips for Submission</h3>
    <p>
        We <i>strongly</i> encourage potential speakers to submit more than one submission on more than one topic. The
        more submissions you contribute, the more options you give us to pick you. Please be detailed and descriptive
        in your talk abstract.
    </p>
